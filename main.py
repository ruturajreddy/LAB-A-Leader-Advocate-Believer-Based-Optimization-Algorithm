# LAB full implementation will be done here
# 3 types of individuals leaders, advocates and believers 
# All working and updating together to reach convergence together
# Calculate first total number of individuals and then accordingly divide them equally
# Put them into a list by dividing them equally
# Make groups, as many as required
# 	for e.g if asked for a total of 4 groups of 5 individuals each 
# 		calculate it accordingly as 20 total individuals 
# 		so first ask for groups and individuals and then make the total count 


# create a list at first of all the people in a society 
#

INDI = 5
ITERATIONS = 100
TOTAL = GROUPS*INDI
